<button type="button" class="collapsible">Who owns the algorithm intellectual property?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>All algorithms you submit to the competition remain your intellectual property even if you win a competition. All the algorithms you create in QuantConnect remain your IP.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can funds see my algorithm source code?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>QuantConnect hosts your algorithm in our data center and distributes the signals to subscribed institutions. The institutions can analyze the signals and trades your algorithm produces but cannot view your source code.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I submit my algorithm?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Easily submit in the Alpha Stream Marketplace:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Make sure you're registered with a QuantConnect account as an Alpha Author.</li>
    <li>Go to the Alpha Market submission page.</li>
    <li>Submit your alpha with the universe tagged.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What kind of algorithms are you looking for?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The sponsoring client is seeking long-only Alpha Streams for the 5 ETF categories. Algorithms will be judged on live out of sample track record, combined with merit given to model practicality. The backtest needs to start 5 years or more from the date of submission (at a minimum the start date should be 2014, 10, 1).</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What kind of data can I use?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In addition to extensive financial data, we have alternative data sources available as well. Read more about Tingo, US Treasury Yield Curve, PsychSignal, TradingEconomics, SEC, and SmartInsider here. Using data sources that were not provided by QuantConnect will result in disqualification.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can my Alphas still be licensed in the marketplace?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The sponsoring client earns the first option to license the alpha exclusively for 90 days. Afterward, alphas can be licensed through the Alpha Market to any participating institution.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Is there a limit to the number of algorithms I can submit?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>There is a limit of one algorithm submission per day. QuantConnect reserves the right to limit or refuse the submissions of participants who are abusing the submission process.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Is there a limit to how many prizes I can win?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>One account can win up to three prizes. An algorithm may not win more than one prize.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is the Alpha Five competition timeline?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You must enter at or before 11:59 pm EST on October 31, 2019. Algorithms will be tested on their live performance in paper trades from November 1 to December 30. Competition winners will be announced on December 31 at 8:00 pm EST.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Is there an entrance fee for the competition?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>No.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I work with a team?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Collaboration on algorithms is allowed, but QuantConnect will not be involved with prize division. Submissions are the sole responsibility of the registered account holder of the account submitting the algorithm. Please do not submit the same entry for a team from multiple accounts.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Where can I go if I have questions about my algorithm or want to share my ideas?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We have set up the competition forum as a central discussion board for all things competition-related.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">There is an option to price my algorithm on the Alpha Market submission page. How should I price my algorithm?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We recommend waiting 2-3 months to build an out-of-sample track record before setting a price for your Alpha, using the default pricing at the time of submission. How you price your algorithm will not affect its standing in the competition.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What happens if I submit and then want to make changes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You can submit an updated algorithm, but it will count towards your daily submission limit. Updates are still subject to review. Any updates submitted after the submission deadline will not be considered for a prize.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What are some restrictions to participating? I'm from outside the US, can I participate?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You can find the full contest rules here: <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/competitions/alpha-five#rules">https://www.quantconnect.com/competitions/alpha-five#rules</a>.</p>
