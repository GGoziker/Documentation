This directory contains the text and code snippets of our current documentation, converted from html to rst.

The .rst files belong in ./docs/source

To test that .rst files generate the proper .html files: open terminal, navigate to docs folder, and run 'make html'. The generated .html files will appear in ./docs/build/html.
