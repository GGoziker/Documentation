Introduction
============

The community is a great resource for support on developing algorithms. However, you can also subscribe to professional support from a member of quantconnect. Members in your organization need a support seat to submit a support ticket. There are three tiers of support seats available with various levels of support. You can add support seats available in the Support tab in the Algorithm Lab.

**Bronze**

The bronze seat provides you with email support from a QuantConnect engineer. Your submitted support tickets will have a response time of around 72 hours.

The silver seat includes the services provided by the bronze tier with faster response times, and up to 8 tickets per month. The silver seat also includes design suggestions for your project. A QuantConnect engineer will help you find the best way to implement your project. This tier is best for quants or a team of quants that develop algorithms with more complex needs such as large algorithms.
