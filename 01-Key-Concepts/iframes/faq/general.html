<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I know my intellectual property and algorithm source code are secure?</button>
<div class="content">

  <p>We take protecting your intellectual property very seriously. <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/key-concepts/getting-started#Getting-Started-Security--Privacy">We limit the access to the database to key team member who need it</a>, and ensure they have no conflict of interest from trading on our personal accounts.<br><br>For those especially concerned we have <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/">open sourced the LEAN engine</a>, allowing you to do algorithmic trading entirely on your own servers - proving we're truly trying to empower your trading.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I get started learning algorithmic trading or quant finance?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Learning quantitative trading is especially difficult as there is so little public information available. We have sought to address this through the educational materials we make available. We provide a Bootcamp for those unfamiliar with programming or trading concepts, a series of tutorials on implementing a quantitative strategy, and our YouTube channel which is intended to guide you on using the QC API. Inside the Algorithm Lab have the QC University which is a collection of 100+ demonstration algorithms to help you get started.<br><br>The QuantConnect community and the algorithms they share are also a great way to get started. There are thousands of members just like yourself who share their journey.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">I can't code, do you have a visual editor to design algorithms?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We do not have any plans to build a visual algorithm designer. We believe the only way to make money in the markets is with the most powerful, flexible tools available. We recently designed the Algorithm Framework which allows relatively easily assembly of coding blocks to design an algorithm but you still need to have a strong foundation in code. Its this belief which has powered many of the design decisions behind QuantConnect. We were algorithmic traders ourselves for 3 years and built hundreds of algorithms. They ranged from the simple, to incredibly complex. The common theme among them was the need for flexibility which can only be achieved through raw code.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What libraries are white-listed for use in QuantConnect?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>See a full list of white listed libraries in our Documentation/Supported Libraries section.<br><br>If your library is not there and you want it added please let us know.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What brokerages do you support? Do you have live trading?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We support live trading with Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, GDAX, FXCM, OANDA, and Bitfinex. We also allow you to do paper trading with Equity, Crypto, Forex and CFD data.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Is this free? How will you make money?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We work hard to make QuantConnect free for everyone to use. Since education has always been a core value, live trading is free for all students logging in with a .edu address. For everyone else, we have sponsorships from brokerages that want to attract your trading and hedge funds that want to offer you investment. In addition we charge a small fee for infrastructure upgrades such as more powerful live servers and RAM upgrades.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How can you guarantee security of an algorithm on your cloud?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>There can never be any guarantee of security with online websites as we've seen over and over again in recent years. However we deploy all modern and common security procedures. We deploy nightly software updates to keep the server up to date with the latest security patches. We used SSH key login to avoid reliance on passwords.<br><br>Your code is stored in a database, isolated from the internet. When the code leaves the database it is compiled and obfuscated before being deployed to the cloud. If the cloud servers were compromised this makes it difficult to read your strategy.<br><br>Internally we use processes to ensure only a handful of people have access to the database; and always restrict logins to never use root credentials.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is QuantConnect?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We believe in making the best possible automated investment tools available to everyone. By leveling the playing fields in the financial markets we can bring about a new, automated era of investment management.<br><br>We are a community of algorithmic engineers, data scientists, statisticians, coders, geeks and scientists who enjoy modelling and trading in the financial markets.<br><br>With the QuantConnect Algorithm Lab users can design algorithmic trading strategies and trade them on their personal brokerage accounts. You write code directly into your browser, compile your algorithm, and then send it to be backtested. The backtesting cloud is the most powerful in the world, second only to major banks and hedgefunds. We can spin up hundreds of CPUs to ensure your algorithm completes in a few minutes.<br><br>Our technology was based from our personal experience. We founded an algorithmic fund and traded high frequency strategies live for 2 years. This powerful infrastructure has been tested with millions of dollars of trading volume, and thousands of backtests. It was built for speed to ensure the fastest design iterations possible.</p>
