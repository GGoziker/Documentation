Introduction
============
We're proud to be running a series of competitions focused on Alpha Streams development solicited by specific client funds. Alpha Streams clients provide a profile of algorithms they'd like to license, and the community has a chance to submit matching algorithms and win immediate cash prizes for their submissions.

Intellectual Property
=====================
Algorithms submitted to a competition remain your intellectual property. The sponsoring client is allowed a 90-day first option for an exclusive license from the end of the competition. After the 90 day window, they can be licensed through the Alpha Streams market to any participating institution.
